# Lohrasbi Architecture Lab  
### System Architecture | Healthcare Transformation | Symbiotic Intelligence | Health Nation OS

The **Lohrasbi Architecture Lab** is a research and engineering workspace focused on building _next-generation healthcare systems_ using **System Architecture**, **AI-native governance**, and **Symbiotic Intelligence**.  
This repository hosts the foundational artifacts, blueprints, and conceptual frameworks used to redesign healthcare systems beyond incremental reform.

---

## 🧠 Mission
To architect **viable, anti-fragile, and AI-augmented health systems** by replacing the repair-based mindset with **Architectural Thinking**.  
We design healthcare as an integrated ecosystem — not a provider network.

## 🏛 Core Themes

### 1. **Healthcare Architecture**
- System topology  
- Operational doctrines  
- Architectural viability  
- Macro–micro coherence  

### 2. **Symbiotic Intelligence**
- Human–AI co-governance  
- AI-native decision systems  
- Intelligent control loops  
- Autonomic health operations  

### 3. **Health Nation OS**
- National-scale digital health stack  
- Identity, safety, continuity, and resilience  
- Interoperability as architecture, not software
